# perfect-num 2022
This was a question on one of my tests for CSCI 3333 Programming Languages. The prompt was to find out if a number was a perfect number by using functional programming in Python.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors

# triangle-area 2022
This was an assignment for CSCI 3333 Programming Languages. 

prompt:
Write a program in Python, only using Python's functional programming elements, that performs the following computation:

Given a list of triangles, represented by the lengths of their 3 sides generate a list with only the equilateral
triangles. Then for the list of equilateral triangles, generate a list of the areas of the given those triangles.
